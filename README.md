# Cat-Neural-Network
My first neural network program. Comes from the Coursera course.

The course can be found <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning/home/welcome">here</a>.
The task of this neural network is to compare a deep neural network to a two-layer neural network and see how their loss functions compare.
When run, this takes the input of cat pictures and attempts to figure out if other pictures have cats in them.

<h2>Understanding the Files</h2>

<h3>Building_Your_Deep_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v8a.ipynb</h3>
This file contains many of the functions which will be used for the deep learning algorithm.

<h3>Deep+Neural_Network+-+Application+v8.ipynb</h3>
This file is the neural network which will be run.
